## 2. Multiple Problems Per Exercise with Sequential Unlocking

**Goal:** Allow exercises to have multiple problems (like hints), unlock "Next Problem" button when current is complete.

**Implementation Plan:**

### 2.1 Backend Changes

1. **ExerciseEntity/ExerciseViewDto** - Modify fields:
   - `graspableInitialExpression` → Keep as is (semicolon-separated: "2x+5=15;3x-7=20;x^2=9")
   - `graspableTargetExpression` → Add this field (semicolon-separated: "x=5;x=9;x=3")
   - Parse expressions by splitting on `;` or `|`

2. **GraspableMathService** - Add session tracking:
   - `StudentSessionEntity.currentProblemIndex` (new field, default 0)
   - Track which problem in the sequence student is working on
   - Method: `int getCurrentProblemIndex(String sessionId)`
   - Method: `void advanceToNextProblem(String sessionId)`

3. **Database Changes:**
   - Add `current_problem_index INT DEFAULT 0` to `student_sessions` table
   - Add `graspable_target_expression VARCHAR(1000)` to `exercises` table
   - Add them to the existing init script - do NOT create separate scripts

### 2.2 Frontend Changes

1. **ExerciseWorkspaceView** - Add UI components:
   - Field: `int currentProblemIndex = 0`
   - Field: `String[] problems` (parsed from `exercise.graspableInitialExpression`)
   - Field: `String[] targetExpressions` (parsed from `exercise.graspableTargetExpression`)
   - Button: `nextProblemButton` (initially disabled)

2. **Problem Navigation:**
   - Load problem at index `currentProblemIndex` initially
   - When `checkCompletion()` returns true:
     - Enable `nextProblemButton` if `currentProblemIndex < problems.length - 1`
     - Disable canvas interactions until next problem loaded
   - On "Next Problem" click:
     - Increment `currentProblemIndex`
     - Call `graspableMathService.advanceToNextProblem(sessionId)`
     - Load next problem expression
     - Disable button again, re-enable canvas
   - Display progress: "Problem 2 of 3" in hints section

3. **Completion State:**
   - When last problem is completed, show final success message
   - Mark entire session as complete in database
   - Show "Back to Exercises" or "Review Session" options

4. **Admin/Teacher View**
   - Exercise creation form: Add help text explaining semicolon-separated format
   - Example: "2x+5=15;3x-7=20" → Two problems in sequence

---

## 3. Admin Views for Progress Tracking

**Goal:** Create admin-only views to monitor student sessions, AI interactions, and overall progress.

**Implementation Plan:**

### 3.1 Backend Changes

1. **New Service:** `AnalyticsService.java` (@ApplicationScoped)
   - `List<StudentSessionViewDto> getAllSessions()`
   - `List<StudentSessionViewDto> getSessionsByUser(Long userId)`
   - `List<StudentSessionViewDto> getSessionsByExercise(Long exerciseId)`
   - `List<AIInteractionViewDto> getAIInteractionsBySession(String sessionId)`
   - `StudentProgressSummaryDto getUserProgressSummary(Long userId)`
   - `Map<String, Integer> getProblemCategoryStats()` (how many problems solved per category)

2. **New DTOs:**
   - `StudentSessionViewDto` (expand existing with user/exercise names)
   - `AIInteractionViewDto` (event type, feedback given, timestamp)
   - `StudentProgressSummaryDto`:
     - `Long userId`, `String username`
     - `int totalSessions`, `int completedSessions`
     - `int totalProblems`, `int completedProblems`
     - `int hintsUsed`, `int averageActionsPerProblem`
     - `LocalDateTime lastActivity`

3. **Entity Enhancement:**
   - Ensure `AIInteractionEntity` has all needed fields:
     - `sessionId`, `eventType`, `feedbackMessage`, `timestamp`

### 3.2 Frontend Changes

1. **New View:** `AdminDashboardView.java` (@Route "admin/dashboard")
   - Check user rank permissions (`rank.adminView == true`)
   - Display overview cards:
     - Total sessions today/week/month
     - Active students
     - Most attempted exercises
   - Charts/graphs (use Vaadin Charts if available, or simple tables)

2. **New View:** `StudentSessionsView.java` (@Route "admin/sessions")
   - Grid displaying all sessions with filters:
     - Columns: Student, Exercise, Start Time, Duration, Completed, Hints Used, Actions
     - Filter by: Student (dropdown), Exercise (dropdown), Date range, Completion status
   - Click row → Navigate to detailed session view

3. **New View:** `SessionDetailView.java` (@Route "admin/session/:sessionId")
   - Display complete session timeline:
     - Each action taken (expression before/after)
     - AI feedback given for each action
     - Hints revealed
     - Time spent on each step
   - Reconstruct the student's problem-solving path
   - Show final outcome (completed/abandoned)

4. **New View:** `StudentProgressView.java` (@Route "admin/progress")
   - Grid of all students with summary statistics
   - Columns: Username, Sessions, Completed, Success Rate, Last Activity
   - Click row → Detailed student profile with:
     - Session history
     - Strengths/weaknesses analysis (based on problem categories)
     - Time trends (improving/struggling)

5. **Navigation:**
   - Add "Admin" tab to MainLayout navigation bar (visible only if `rank.adminView == true`)
   - Submenu: Dashboard, Sessions, Student Progress

### 3.3 Security

- Add checks in `beforeEnter()` for all admin views:

  ```java
  if (!authService.hasAdminView()) {
      event.rerouteTo(HomeView.class);
      NotificationUtil.showError("Access denied");
  }
  ```

---

## 4. Comments on Exercises (student comments & discussion)

**Goal:** Let students comment on exercises and lessons, support threaded discussions, moderation and admin management. The repository already contains some comment-related entities and admin views; this task documents what is still missing and provides a concrete implementation checklist to fully support comments across backend, frontend, database, admin moderation, and tests.

### Current state (as reported)

- Entities, DTOs, service and admin views for comments already exist in the codebase (verify by searching for and then reviewing `CommentEntity`, `CommentService`, `CommentDto`, `CommentViewDto`, `AdminCommentView` in the project).
- What appears to be missing or incomplete: Vaadin components on the exercise view to display and post comments, realtime updates (server push) for new comments, potential DB changes (init script, entity, DTOs, ...), and comprehensive tests.

### Key requirements (high level)

- Users can create comments on exercises and lessons (if they have the `comment:add` permission).
- Comments should support replies (threading) and simple formatting (plain text, optional markdown-lite).
- Users can edit/delete their own comments; teachers/admins can edit/delete all comments.
- Admins can view, filter, edit and permanently delete comments via existing admin views.
- Comments must be associated with exerciseId, sessionId (optional), userId and timestamp.
- Real-time UI updates (Vaadin server push, no polling) so students see new comments without full page refresh.
- Audit/logging of moderation edits and deletes.
- Rate-limiting/anti-spam.

### Missing pieces (detailed analysis)

1. Comment DTOs and view models
   - `CommentDto` (for create/update requests) with fields: `exerciseId`, `lessonId` (optional), `parentCommentId` (nullable), `text`.
   - `CommentViewDto` (for rendering) with fields: `id`, `exerciseId`, `lessonId`, `parentId`, `authorId`, `authorName`, `text`, `createdAt`, `editedAt`, `status` (VISIBLE/HIDDEN/DELETED), `sessionId`, `flagsCount`.

2. CommentService contract and implementation
   - Methods to implement (ApplicationScoped service):
     - `CommentViewDto createComment(CommentDto dto, Long authorId)`
     - `CommentViewDto editComment(Long commentId, CommentDto dto, Long editorId)`
     - `void deleteComment(Long commentId, Long requesterId, boolean softDelete)` (soft delete preserves audit trail)
     - `List<CommentViewDto> listCommentsByExercise(Long exerciseId, int page, int size, Optional<Long> parentId)`
     - `List<CommentViewDto> listCommentsBySession(String sessionId)`
     - `void moderateComment(Long commentId, ModerationAction action, Long moderatorId, String reason)`
     - `void flagComment(Long commentId, Long userId, String reason)`
   - Security checks: only author or admin can edit/delete (respect soft-delete window), moderators/admins can override.

3. Database / schema
   - If `CommentEntity` exists, ensure the init SQL includes the table definition (columns and constraints). If not present, add to the existing init script (do NOT create a separate migration script per project guidelines). Required columns:
     - `id` (PK), `exercise_id` (FK nullable), `lesson_id` (FK nullable), `session_id` (varchar nullable), `parent_comment_id` (FK nullable), `author_id` (FK), `text` (text), `created_at` (timestamp), `edited_at` (timestamp nullable), `status` (varchar, default 'VISIBLE'), `flags_count` (int default 0), `deleted_by` (nullable), `deleted_at` (nullable)
   - Indexes: `exercise_id`, `lesson_id`, `parent_comment_id`, `author_id` for efficient queries.

4. Vaadin UI integration
   - Exercise view (`ExerciseWorkspaceView` / `GraspableMathView`):
     - Add a `CommentsPanel` component (threaded list + new comment form) placed beside or below the Graspable canvas.
     - The component should request initial comments via a server call (injected `CommentService`) and subscribe to server push for new comment events.
     - Comment composer: text area, submit button, optional reply-to handling, client-side validation, character limit.
     - For authors: show edit/delete controls; for moderators: show moderate/hide/delete controls.
     - Pagination or lazy-loading of long threads.

5. Real-time updates and notifications
   - Implement Vaadin push (if enabled) or fallback to short polling (e.g., fetch new comments every X seconds).
   - Optionally fire `UI.access()` updates when `CommentService.createComment` is called from server side or when a WebSocket broadcast announces a new comment.
   - Publish comment events for users in the same exercise/session using an application-scoped broadcaster (e.g., CDI Event or small message hub).

6. Admin moderation & audit
   - Ensure admin views include filters for comments by exercise, author, status, flagged count, and date range.
   - Add audit logging for moderation actions (who hid/deleted/edited, timestamp, reason). Link to `AIInteractionEntity` or a dedicated `CommentModerationEntity` if audit trail is required.

7. Spam, rate limiting, and abuse mitigation
   - Implement basic rate limiting per user (e.g., 1 comment per 5s, 200 comments/day) in `CommentService`.
   - Add flagging workflow: when flagged by N users, auto-hide or queue for review.
   - Optionally integrate a third-party moderation API (AI-based profanity/spam check) at create time.

8. Tests
   - Unit tests for `CommentService` (create/edit/delete/list/moderation, permission checks, rate limits).
   - Integration tests that exercise DB writes and queries (session/comment linking, parent/child thread behavior).
   - UI tests for `CommentsPanel` (posting, replying, edit/delete visibility based on permissions).

9. Documentation & admin help
   - Update `README.md` and `docs/Quickstart.md` (if necessary) with short note about comments (privacy, moderation rules).
   - Add an entry to developer docs describing the comment schema and how to wire the `CommentsPanel` into exercise views.

### Implementation checklist (step-by-step)

1. Audit repository for existing comment artifacts
   - Search for `CommentEntity`, `CommentService`, `CommentController`, `CommentView` and note which parts are implemented. Record filenames.

2. Add/verify DTOs
   - Create `CommentDto.java` and `CommentViewDto.java` in `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/dto/` if missing.

3. Add/verify `CommentService` (@ApplicationScoped)
   - Implement methods listed above with permission checks, rate limiting, and flagging support.

4. Ensure DB schema/init scripts include comment table
   - Add required columns and indexes into the existing SQL init script used by the project.

5. Vaadin `CommentsPanel` component
   - Build a reusable component that can be embedded into `ExerciseWorkspaceView` and other places.
   - Support pagination, replying, edit/delete controls, and moderation UI for admins.

6. Real-time notifications
   - Add a simple in-app broadcaster (CDI Event or small hub) to notify sessions of new comments; implement Vaadin push handler or polling fallback.

7. Admin views & moderation
   - Hook into existing admin views: add comment filters, list, and moderation actions if needed.

8. Tests
   - Add unit and integration tests. Run `mvn test` and fix issues.

9. Docs & README
   - Add short usage and privacy note.

### Edge cases & additional notes

- Consider whether comments should be versioned or soft-deleted (recommended to soft-delete and keep audit).
- Consider attachments/images later — start with text-only.
- Consider rate-limits, abuse reporting, and export of comment data for teachers.
- Performance: paginate and index heavily; for very large classes consider caching/recent-only view.

## 5. AdminConfigView: Runtime AI Provider/Model/Settings Management

**Goal:** Transform the admin home view into `AdminConfigView`, allowing users with admin privileges to change application-wide AI settings at runtime.

**Implementation Plan:**

### 5.1 Backend Changes

1. **Config Properties:**
   - Rename `ai.tutor.provider` → `ai.tutor.default.provider`
   - Rename `gemini.model` → `gemini.default.model`
   - Rename `openai.model` → `openai.default.model`
   - Rename `ollama.model` → `ollama.default.model`
   - Add unified properties for `ai.tutor.max-tokens` and `ai.tutor.temperature` (not per-provider)
   - Add `openai.organization-id`, `ollama.timeout-seconds`, and provider-specific API URLs

2. **Service:**
   - Add service for updating config properties at runtime (with validation and security checks)

### 5.2 Frontend Changes

1. **AdminConfigView:**
   - Replace admin home view with a config panel for AI settings
   - Dropdowns for AI provider and model (model dropdown updates when provider changes)
   - Disable Gemini/OpenAI if API key is unset ("your-api-key-here"), disable Ollama if URL is unset ("your-ollama-api-url-here")
   - Inputs for max-tokens and temperature (always visible, affect selected provider)
   - Inputs for OpenAI organization ID and Ollama timeout (hidden unless respective provider selected, ideally with smooth animation)
   - Input for API URL (affects only selected provider)

2. **UI/UX:**
   - Show/hide provider-specific fields with subtle animation
   - Ensure only one set of model/temperature/max-tokens fields, always reflecting selected provider

### 5.3 Security & Validation

1. Only users with admin privileges can access and change settings
2. Validate all inputs before saving
3. Changes should take effect immediately for new AI interactions

### 5.4 Testing

- Unit tests for config update service
- Integration tests for runtime config changes
- Manual UI testing for all provider/model combinations and field visibility

---

## 6. Gamification

**Goal:** Increase student motivation and engagement by adding gamification elements such as achievements/badges, progress levels, experience points (XP), streaks, leaderboards, and rewards tied to problem solving within the Graspable Math workspace and overall course progress.

This feature should be opt-in per user (privacy-friendly), configurable by admins, and designed to be low-friction so it does not interfere with learning objectives.

### 6.1 High-level features

- Achievements/Badges: award for specific milestones (e.g., "First Solution", "10 Problems Solved", "Perfect Session", "Fast Solver", "Hint Avoider").
- Experience points (XP): reward XP for solved problems, streaks, and completing exercises. XP contributes to user Level.
- Levels & Progress Bar: users level up based on XP thresholds; show a progress bar on dashboard and exercise view.
- Daily Streaks: consecutive days with activity—rewards and streak badges.
- Leaderboards: global and class/group leaderboards showing top XP or most problems solved. Respect privacy settings (opt-in/opt-out, show anonymized handles).
- Challenges & Quests: time-limited or teacher-assigned challenges (e.g., "Solve 5 linear equations this week") with rewards.
- Rewards & Unlocks: unlock cosmetic rewards (avatars, themes), extra practice problems, or hints currency that can be spent.
- Notifications & Activity Feed: notify users when they earn badges, level up, or climb the leaderboard.

### 6.2 Backend changes

1. New Entities (Hibernate/Panache style):
   - `BadgeEntity` - id, code, name, description, iconPath, criteriaJson, createdAt
   - `UserBadgeEntity` - id, userId, badgeId, awardedAt, source (auto/manual)
   - `UserXpEntity` - id, userId, totalXp, level, nextLevelXp, lastUpdated
   - `UserStreakEntity` - id, userId, currentStreakDays, lastActiveDate
   - `ChallengeEntity` - id, title, description, startDate, endDate, rewardXp, rewardBadgeId, createdBy
   - `UserChallengeEntity` - id, userId, challengeId, progressJson, completedAt
   - `LeaderboardSnapshotEntity` (optional) - snapshotDate, rankingJson (for caching)

2. Service classes:
   - `GamificationService` (@ApplicationScoped)
     - awardBadge(userId, badgeCode, source)
     - addXp(userId, amount, reason)
     - incrementStreak(userId, date)
     - getUserBadges(userId)
     - getUserXpAndLevel(userId)
     - getLeaderboards(scope, groupId, limit)
     - evaluateAndAwardOnProblemSolved(sessionId, eventDto) — called from GraspableMathService or AITutorService when problems are solved
   - `ChallengeService` - create/manage challenges, track user progress

3. DTOs
   - `BadgeDto`, `UserBadgeDto`, `UserXpDto`, `ChallengeDto`, `LeaderboardDto`

4. DB migrations / schema updates
   - Add tables for each new entity. As per project style, add fields to existing init scripts (do NOT add separate scripts).
   - Add indexes on `userId` and `badgeCode` where helpful.

5. Integration points
   - Call `GamificationService.evaluateAndAwardOnProblemSolved(...)` from `GraspableMathService` whenever a problem is marked complete.
   - Call `addXp(...)` when user actions qualify (fast solve bonus, no-hint bonus, perfect session).
   - Update `StudentSessionEntity` to optionally record `xpEarned` for the session and `badgesAwardedJson` (or rely on `UserBadgeEntity`).

### 6.3 Frontend changes (Vaadin views)

1. New Views/Components
   - `GamificationPanel` component: compact widget to show current level, XP progress bar, recent badges, and quick action to view full gamification profile.
   - `BadgesView` (@Route "badges") - list of all badges with filters (earned/not earned), and badge details.
   - `LeaderboardView` (@Route "leaderboard") - toggle between global, class/group, and friends.
   - `ChallengesView` (@Route "challenges") - list active/past challenges and allow users to join (if allowed).
   - Integrate small toast/notification UI in `ExerciseWorkspaceView` for immediate feedback when a badge is earned or XP awarded.

2. UI behavior
   - Show XP progress bar in the main user dashboard and in `ExerciseWorkspaceView` (top-right corner) so users can see immediate progress.
   - When a badge is earned, show a celebratory modal/toast with badge icon and description; include an unobtrusive "share" option (copy link or classroom share).
   - Leaderboard toggles to respect privacy: anonymize names if user opted out of public rankings.
   - Provide settings in `UserProfileView` for gamification opt-in/out and visibility preferences.

3. Admin Controls
   - Extend `AdminConfigView` (or new `AdminGamificationView`) to manage badges, XP rules, level thresholds, challenge creation, and leaderboard settings.
   - Allow admins/teachers to award badges manually.

### 6.4 XP, Levels, and Rules (example policy)

- Base XP per solved problem: 10 XP
- Bonus: +5 XP for solving without hints
- Speed bonus: up to +10 XP proportional to time under expected time
- Streak bonus: +2 XP per consecutive day active (capped)
- Challenge completion: rewardXp per challenge config
- Level thresholds: exponential or pre-configured table (e.g., Level 1: 0 XP, Level 2: 100 XP, Level 3: 300 XP, Level 4: 700 XP)

Keep rules configurable via `AdminGamificationView`.

### 6.5 Privacy & Accessibility

- Gamification must be opt-in for students; default can be enabled but provide a clear toggle in profile.
- Allow students to hide their name from leaderboards (opt-out) and to use an alias.
- Ensure badges and colors are accessible (contrast, screen-reader friendly alt text for icons).

### 6.6 Testing

- Unit tests for `GamificationService` (award logic, XP calculations, level progression).
- Integration tests for DB writes (badge awards, XP updates, streak increments).
- UI tests for badge modal display and leaderboard filtering.
- Load testing/benchmarks for leaderboard queries (cache snapshots if needed).

### 6.7 Metrics & Analytics

- Track gamification engagement metrics: percent of users opting in, average XP earned per session, badge earn rates, churn/retention impact.
- Add events to existing logging/analytics pipeline (e.g., `GAMIFICATION_BADGE_AWARDED`, `GAMIFICATION_XP_ADDED`).

### 6.8 Phased rollout and migration

- Phase 1 (MVP): XP, badges for a small default set (First Solution, 10 Problems, No Hints), user opt-in, basic UI panel, and admin config for enabling/disabling.
- Phase 2: Add leaderboards, challenges, rewards/unlocks, and teacher tools.
- Phase 3: Advanced features like seasonal events, classroom competitions, and integration with external LMS.

### 6.9 Risks and mitigations

- Reward focus over learning: design badges to align tightly with learning goals (e.g., accuracy, explanation, reflection), not just speed.
- Privacy concerns: defaults and opt-outs must be clear and honored.
- Cheating via repeated trivial tasks: weight XP and badges to discourage grinding (e.g., cap repeatable XP per day for the same exercise).
